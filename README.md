# mongodb
Learn mongodb (a schema-less NoSQL document database) using 
- Node.js : An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
- Mongoose : An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
- Mocha : A JavaScript test framework for Node.js programs, featuring browser support, asynchronous testing, test coverage reports, and use of any assertion library.
- Nodemon : Simple monitor script for use during development of a node.js app, use nodemon instead of node to run your code, and now your process will automatically restart when your code changes.
- Studio 3T : MongoDB IDE GUI

## Promise
Promise is a tool to implement asynchronous code, it helps implement any code 
that is set to be executed in future.

There are three stages of Promise
1. UnResolved   :   Waiting for precondition code to finish.
2. Resolved :   Result is as expected.
3. Rejected :   Failed case.

will traditionally have one collection for each type of resource that we might
